This project I started on may 2023. Project for parsing av.by page and creating a similar site. For this I used Python, Django Rest Framework, React, JavaScript, CSS.
For data storage I used SQLite DB. 
Created Django admin panel.
At this site we can filter cars for all parameters, sort cars, create user's account, connect telegram bot.
